= Naws::Route53
== A thin interface to AWS Route 53

This gem is still under development. It relies on 
naws[http://github.com/mboeh/naws] and is extended by 
naws-route53-models[http://github.com/mboeh/naws-route53-models].

More specs and documentation are coming soon. This gem is not ready for
production use, but I welcome any input.
